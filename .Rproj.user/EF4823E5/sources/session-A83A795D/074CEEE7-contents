# Question 1
Create separate boxplots of body mass for male and female Adelie penguins. Your boxplots do not have to be in the same panel like mine. Show the R-code you used to make the plots.

```{r}
require(palmerpenguins)
dat_ade = droplevels(subset(penguins, species == "Adelie"))

boxplot(dat_ade$body_mass_g ~ dat_ade$sex, xlab="Sex", ylab="Body Mass (g)", main="Body Mass of Adelie Penguins")
```

# Question 2
Perform a one-sample t-test of the alternative hypothesis that female Adelie penguins have a body mass different from zero grams. Note that this is a very silly alternative hypothesis. Is this a one- or two-tailed test? Show your R-code.

```{r}
dat_ade_f = droplevels(subset(dat_ade, sex == "Female"))
t.test(x = dat_ade_f$body_mass_g,
       mu = 0)
```

	One Sample t-test

data:  dat_ade_f$body_mass_g
t = 106.85, df = 72, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 3305.985 3431.687
sample estimates:
mean of x 

# Question 3
Describe your conclusions based on the p-value of the t-test.

The p-value is less than 2.2 * 10 ^-16. This is extremely tiny, which means we can reject the null hypothesis that female body weight is the same as 0 grams. Such a small p-value suggests statistically significant difference in body weight of female penguins vs. 0 grams. Typically, p-values less than .05 suggest that the null hypothesis can be rejected, and the p-value for this test is well below .05. 

# Question 4
Now, conduct a slightly less silly test: perform a one-sample t-test of the alternative hypothesis that male Adelie penguins have a mean body mass greater than 4000 grams. Is this a one- or two-tailed test?

```{r}
dat_ade_m = droplevels(subset(dat_ade, sex == "Male"))
t.test(x = dat_ade_m$body_mass_g,
       mu = 4000,
       alternative = "greater")
```

# Question 5
Describe your conclusions based on the p-value of the t-test.

The P-value = 0.1438. This means we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the mean body mass is less than or equal to 400 g.

# Question 6
Conduct a two-sample t-test of the alternative hypothesis that male and female Adelie penguins have different mean body masses. Show your r-code.

```{r}
t.test(x = dat_ade_f$body_mass_g, 
       y = dat_ade_m$body_mass_g)
```

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  dat_ade_f$body_mass_g and dat_ade_m$body_mass_g
t = -13.126, df = 135.69, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -776.3012 -573.0139
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 3368.836  4043.493 
 
# Question 7
 Describe your conclusions based on the p-value of the t-test.
 
 The P-value is 2.2e-16 which indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis that the difference in the means of male and female body masses is 0, suggesting there is statistically significant evidence that the two have different body masses.
 
# Question 8
Conduct a two-sample (one-tailed) t-test of the directional alternative hypothesis that male Adelie penguins are heavier than females.

```{r}
t.test(x = dat_ade_m$body_mass_g,
       y = dat_ade_f$body_mass_g,
       alternative = "g")
```

# Question 9
Conduct a two-sample (one-tailed) t-test of the directional alternative hypothesis that male Adelie penguins are lighter than females.

```{r}
t.test(x = dat_ade_m$body_mass_g,
       y = dat_ade_f$body_mass_g,
       alternative = "l")
```

# Question 10
Explain why the p-values are so drastically different in the two directions. 

The p-values are so different because the argument that we are testing for specifically is that male penguins (control) are heavier/lighter than females. Testing males>females, the p-value is 1 while males<females has a resultign p-value of 2.2e-16. Since we are using males>females as the null hypothesis for both, testing that males>females results in p = 1 since we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Alternatively, testing that males<females results in p = 2.2e-16, providing evidence that we can reject the null hypothesis, telling us that there is statistically significant evidence that average male body mass is greater than female body mass.
